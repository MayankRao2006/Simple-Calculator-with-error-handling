1. This is a python code I wrote to increase the challenge on simple calculator. In this code I have tried to handle the errors which occur from either invalid input or incase the user is trying to divide a number by zero. I have also used while statement to keep the loop going unless the user enters the operator to exit the loop. Feel free to reach out to me if you find any mistakes that I can work on. Looking forward to responses.
2. To use the code -
   1st method -
     1. Download the code or the repositiory on your pc.
     2. Open it using VS Code.
     3. Run python file in dedicated terminal
   
   2nd method (recommended) -
     1. Copy and paste the code in a replit program.
     2. run the program
