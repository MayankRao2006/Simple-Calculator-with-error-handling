1. As already mentioned in the description, This is a python code I wrote to increase the challenge on simple calculator. In this code I have tried to handle the errors which occur from either invalid input or incase the user is trying to divide a number by zero. Feel free to reach out to me if you find any mistakes that I can work on. Looking forward to responses.
2. To use the code -
   1st method -
     1. Download the code or the repositiory on your pc.
     2. Open it using VS Code.
     3. Run python file in dedicated terminal
   2nd method (recommended) -
     1. Copy and paste the code in a replit program.
     2. run the program

Note - I apologise if my instructions to use the code are not very clear, I am still very new to github. If you face any issues feel free to reach out to me.
Thank you for checking out my code.
